She
craned
her
neck
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
a
clump
of
bushes
to
the
right
and
then
withdrew
farther
to
obtain
a
better
angle
for
viewing
its
dark
recesses
The
quiet
was
profound
except
for
the
incessant
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
occasional
chirrup
of
some
hardy
bird
braving
the
midday
sun
Gloria
pouted
I
bet
he
went
inside
the
house
and
I
ve
told
him
a
million
times
that
that
s
not
fair
With
tiny
lips
pressed
together
tightly
and
a
severe
frown
crinkling
her
forehead
she
moved
determinedly
toward
the
two-story
building
up
past
the
driveway
Too
late
she
heard
the
rustling
sound
behind
her
followed
by
the
distinctive
and
rhythmic
clump
clump
of
Robbie
s
metal
feet
She
whirled
about
to
see
her
triumphing
companion
emerge
from
hiding
and
make
for
the
home-tree
at
full
speed
Gloria
shrieked
in
dismay
Wait
Robbie
That
wasn
t
fair
Robbie
You
promised
you
wouldn
t
run
until
I
found
you
Her
little
feet
could
make
no
headway
at
all
against
Robbie
s
giant
strides
Then
within
ten
feet
of
the
goal
Robbie
s
pace
slowed
suddenly
to
the
merest
of
crawls
and
Gloria
with
one
final
burst
of
wild
speed
dashed
pantingly
past
him
to
touch
the
welcome
bark
of
home-tree
first
